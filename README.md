# Customer Segmentation and Sales Forecasting for an Online Retail Company (Using Python)

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how customer segmentation and sales forecasting can be implemented in Python for an online retail company. 
Businesses can use RFM segmentation to better target marketing efforts and increase customer retention, while ARIMA can help them optimize stock management and improve revenue forecasting.

## Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels
- sklearn

## Data Sourcing

Data was gotten from kaggle, the dataset contains these columns;Invoice, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, Price, Customer ID, Country

## Conclusion/Recommendation

#### RFM Segmentation

1) Platinum and Gold customers should be rewarded with loyalty programs to encourage repeat purchases.
2) Bronze and Silver customers that haven't purchased for a very long time should be targeted with re-engagement campaigns to win them back.
3) Bronze customers can be excluded from high-cost marketing campaigns to optimize marketing spend.

#### Sales Forecasting

1) Based on the ARIMA modelâ€™s forecast, the company can optimize stock levels to meet upcoming demand and avoid overstocking.
2) Seasonal trends suggest that marketing campaigns should focus on peak sales periods, with adequate preparation for inventory during these times.

The combination of customer segmentation and sales forecasting provides actionable insights for optimizing customer relationship management and inventory planning.
